# Svelte Web Extension preview

This repo showcases [Svelte VSCode extension port to VSCode web](https://github.com/asafamr/svelte-vscode-web)


If you don't know what Svelte is - [go here](https://svelte.dev/)

To enter github.dev mode - [go here](https://github.dev/asafamr/svelte-web-preview) (or just press `.` in Github) you would then asked to install the recommanded `asafamr.svelte-web` extension - if not, install it manually. 

Then, open a Svelte component. You should have most langague tool features in browser - autocompletion, syntax highlighting, full typescript support etc...
